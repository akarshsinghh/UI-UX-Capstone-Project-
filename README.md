This was a capstone project from a course I completed "Web Development - From Wireframes to Prototypes). Used tools like Illustrator and Balsamiq to create and brand a concept, luxurious coffee store called Doppio Experience. 
Implemented standard practices and standard practices to make the most of my learnings from this course.
